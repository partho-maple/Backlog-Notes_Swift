# Description

Backlog notes shows the timeline view of things you want to do.

Writing down things you want to do is the beginning, getting in done is the goal. Backlog Notes nudges you to attend to the things you want to do.

Capture everything you think about doing and view them in the timeline you first thought about them. See something you really want to do but has not been done for a month, this should give you the nudge to get it done. See something hanging around for a month and its not done, maybe its time to delete and move on.

In the app, things are kept simple.

- You think about something todo, add it.
- Find some more information about the todo, update it.
- Achieved what you set out todo, clear it.
- View the timeline. Notice something not relevant anymore, delete it.
